This repository demonstrates the basic and essential functionality of **SignalR** with a simple **Total Views Counter**. It provides a real-time experience where multiple users can see the number of views update dynamically.

## 📌 Features

✅ **Real-time** update of total views count using SignalR  
✅ **WebSocket-based** communication for efficient updates  
✅ **Minimal setup** with .NET 8 backend  
✅ **Scalable and lightweight** implementation  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🟣 **.NET 8** (Backend)
- 📡 **SignalR** (Real-time communication)
- 🖥️ **JavaScript** (Client-side updates)

---

## 📦 Installation and Execution

### 🚀 Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/signalr-totalviews-example.git
cd signalr-totalviews-example
```

### ▶️ Step 2: Run the Project
Execute the following command:
```bash
dotnet run
```

### 🌍 Step 3: Open the Web Page
Once the server is running, open the browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

Every time a new user accesses the page, the **total views counter** will update in real time.

---

## 📜 How It Works
1️⃣ **Client connects to SignalR Hub**  
2️⃣ **Server increments and broadcasts the total views count**  
3️⃣ **All connected clients receive and display the updated count in real time**  

---

## 📌 Future Roadmap 🚀
- [ ] Add **persistent storage** for view count tracking.  
- [ ] Implement **authentication-based filtering** of unique views.  
- [ ] Extend to handle **multiple counters** dynamically.
